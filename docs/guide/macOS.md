## macOS Virtual Machines

It is possible to run macOS Virtual Machines (the same way one can run [Linux containers](linux.md)) on the macOS Community Cluster. 
Simply use `osx_instance` in your `.cirrus.yml` files:

```yaml
osx_instance:
  image: mojave-xcode-10.2

task:
  script: echo "Hello World from macOS!"
```
